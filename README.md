# Variable Type Project
## Project Overview

### What I learned

This project explores a single page layout with animations and clickable links. This is my second time building a website with HTML/CSS. This is the first project that I have used multiple animations. It was also the First project I created with more than one column adn grid layouts. WHich throughout the project seemed to pose a challenge for me. I attempted to show the entire range of variability that this font offers!

### Problem Solving and Accessability

This single page business card website solves the problem of having to scower the internet searching for multiple different axis and choices when researching or looking for a font. I addresses accessability running colors through Adobe Color and lighthouse. For this project I really wanted to focus on accessability. I put a major focus on readability as well as color contrast.

### Feature, Fonts, Design, Mockups

My hero section large animation make this project stand out. I used Forma DJR Variable as my font choice. It conveys the bold but minimal style I was going for with this website. I wanted a more neutral color palette as I was pulling inspiration from magazines and other graphics with similar feeling. My wireframes and mockups were done in Figma.
